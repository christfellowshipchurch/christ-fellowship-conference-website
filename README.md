This is a repository for the Christ Fellowship Conference website. 
The website is a *ReactJS* Web App and uses *GraphQL* to pull content from *Rock RMS*.




## Getting Started

After you have cloned the project, open your terminal. In the directory of your project, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Extras

The app includes built-in components such as the **Navbar**, **Footer**, and **Grid**. These all use content that is set up in *Rock*.

### Pixel Manager

In order to use this component you will need to add your Pixel ID and Google Tracking number to your **.env** file.
